Home-Sweet-Niri: A Personalized Niri Configuration

### Placement

For best management, it is recommended to place the configuration files and folders into your own **`~/.config/`** directory.

### Script Sourcing

You can place the supplementary scripts anywhere on your system. However, if you move them from their default locations, you **must** update the `source` commands within the `.config` files and folders to reflect the new paths.
